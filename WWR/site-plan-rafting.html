    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The intended audience for the website is adults aged 18 and up, familes, and even just groups of friends. The site will be targeting first time white water rafters along with veterans to the sport. Anyone looking for clear and percise information about what they are going to get will be in the right place. The site will mainly be accessed through mobile devices for ease of use but some will use a desktop computer to plan their adventure in advance. Some sites make it hard to find exactly what you're going to get, but this will make it a simple and clear process from start to finish.</p>
