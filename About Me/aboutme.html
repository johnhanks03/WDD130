  <p>
    Hello, my name is John Hanks, I am currently a junior at BYUI, and am studying to be a
    cybersecurity major. I chose this major since it is something that interests me a lot,
    and am excited to pursue a career in the field.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have not taken any web development courses before this so I am excited to gain further
    knowledge on the topic. I am taking this course to build skills and for progress towards
    obtaining my degree.

    I love to go skiing in the wintertime, I also enjoy mountain biking, and spending time
    with my wife. I also enjoy working on cars and trucks.
